# RF-secure-Coded-Communication-System
This project was design to ensure maximum level of secrecy when transmitting data over RF 
from one device to another Securely using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. The 
User will enter a message through the GUI from the PC through a computer keyboard and the 
Message will be Encrypted using AES algorithm and transmitted using RF to the Receiver. On 
the receiver side, The message will be decrypted and they will be alerted that there is a New 
message displayed on the LCD, then they will be prompt to put a password and if and only if the 
password is correct then the transmitted Message will be displayed on the screen Using Arduino

TX_CODED
This is containing the code for the transmition side 

RX_CODED
This is containing The code for the Reciever Side
