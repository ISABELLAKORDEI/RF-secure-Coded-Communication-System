# RF-secure-Coded-Communication-System
Using Arduino im trying to make a secure coded communication system in which i will use Aes encryption and decrytpion to make the device secure as possible i will also add a password system for it ass well to increase security. 
This project was design to ensure maximum level of secrecy when transmitting data over RF 
from one device to another Securely using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. The 
User will enter a message through the GUI from the PC through a computer keyboard and the 
Message will be Encrypted using AES algorithm and transmitted using RF to the Receiver. On 
the receiver side, The message will be decrypted and they will be alerted that there is a New 
message displayed on the LCD, then they will be prompt to put a password and if and only if the 
password is correct then the transmitted Message will be displayed on the screen.
